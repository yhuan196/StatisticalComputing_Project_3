#### 3. Compute posterior summaries and 95% credible intervals of $\gamma$, the fixed effects associated with the covariates in the model. Using the estimated Bayesian model, answer the following questions: (1) are there seasonal differences in hurricane wind speeds, and (2) is there evidence to support the claim that hurricane wind speeds have been increasing over the years?
